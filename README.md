jQuery Accordion
================

Responsive, CSS powered, jQuery accordion plugin.

Jquery Accordion uses CSS transitions to animate opening/closing with a fallback to jQuery's animate when CSS transitions are not supported. It takes little configuration or code to use it on your project. [Check out our demos](//vctrfrnndz.github.io/jquery-accordion)
